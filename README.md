# Labs Repository

Welcome to my personal labs repository! This is a collection of practice exercises, coding challenges, and experimental projects designed to explore different programming concepts, debug various types of bugs, and work through different development scenarios.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning playground where I:
- Practice debugging different types of bugs (syntax errors, logic errors, runtime errors, etc.)
- Experiment with various programming scenarios and edge cases
- Build small applications to test different technologies and frameworks
- Document solutions and learning experiences
- Create reproducible bug scenarios for learning purposes

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each lab is designed to be self-contained and focuses on specific learning objectives. Labs may include:
- **Bug Reproduction Labs**: Exercises that demonstrate specific bug types and their solutions
- **Scenario-based Labs**: Real-world scenarios to practice problem-solving
- **Application Labs**: Small applications built to learn new technologies
- **Algorithm Labs**: Data structures and algorithm practice
- **Framework Labs**: Experiments with different frameworks and libraries

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each lab directory contains its own README with:
- Objective and learning goals
- Setup instructions
- Problem description
- Expected vs actual behavior (for bug labs)
- Solution approach (when applicable)

## 💡 Lab Categories

Labs are organized into different categories based on their focus:
- **Debugging Practice**: Various bug types and debugging techniques
- **Code Quality**: Refactoring, code smells, and best practices
- **Performance**: Optimization and performance issues
- **Security**: Common security vulnerabilities and fixes
- **Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, and TDD practice
- **General Programming**: Mixed programming challenges and exercises

## 📝 Contributing

This is a personal learning repository, but if you'd like to suggest improvements or additional lab ideas:
1. Open an issue with your suggestion
2. Describe the learning objective
3. Provide any relevant context or resources

## 🛠️ Technologies

Labs may include various technologies, languages, and frameworks such as:
- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, etc.
- Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, etc.
- Databases: SQL, NoSQL, etc.
- Tools: Git, Docker, CI/CD, etc.

## 📚 Learning Resources

Each lab may reference external resources, documentation, or tutorials that helped in understanding and solving the challenges.

## 📄 License

This repository is for educational purposes. Feel free to use the code and examples for your own learning.
